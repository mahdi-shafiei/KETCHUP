# KETCHUP
Kinetic Estimation Tool Capturing Heterogeneous Datasets Using Pyomo (KETCHUP)

# Description
Repository for Kinetic Estimation Tool Capturing Heterogeneous Datasets Using Pyomo (KETCHUP), a flexible parameter estimation tool that leverages a primal-dual interior-point algorithm to solve a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that identifies a set of parameters capable of recapitulating the steady-state fluxes and concentrations in wild-type and perturbed metabolic networks. [1]

KETCHUP can use K-FIT [2] input files. Example K-FIT input files are located in the K-FIT repository at https://github.com/maranasgroup/K-FIT.

KETCHUP is extended to time-series data [3].

# Installation
In order to install directly using the environment file provided in the installation directory, anaconda needs to be previously installed. To install a self-contained environment for KETCHUP, activate the anaconda prompt and type:
```conda env create -f <path to environment.yml file>```

# Examples and Graphical User Interface
Command line python examples and a streamlit-based graphical user interface are provided. Please see https://streamlit.io for instructions on installing streamlit.
